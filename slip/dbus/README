This package contains slip.dbus.service.TimeoutObject which easily allows to
create dbus-activated services which end themselves when its clients disconnect
from the bus.

This is helpful if you want your service to survive along with its client(s)
because it e.g. contains non-trivial state, does other things on startup
which are expensive in some way or monitors other things and notifies dbus
clients about it.
